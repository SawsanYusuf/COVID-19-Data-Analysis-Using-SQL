In this project, we performed **exploratory data analysis** to evaluate infection rates, mortality trends, and vaccination progress across countries and continents.  

To achieve this, we leveraged **Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Temporary Tables, and Window Functions** to extract meaningful insights and track the pandemicâ€™s progression.  

Additionally, we analyzed global vaccination data, implementing **rolling calculations** to measure population coverage over time.
